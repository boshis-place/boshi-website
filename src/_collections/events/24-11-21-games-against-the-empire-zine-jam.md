  boshi's x txtbooks. an experimental zine jam exploring themes of anti-imperialism through collaborative zine-making
---
ZINE JAMS AGAINST THE EMPIRE!! join us at boshi's place on thurs 11/21 @ 10am et (doors open at 9:30am et) for an experimental zine workshop in partnership with [txtbooks](https://www.txtbooks.us/), exploring themes of anti-imperialism through collaborative zine-making. in this 3-hour session, boshi's place will provide all the necessary materials to create a zine together.

## what to expect:
- opt into generative writing, drawing, and collaging prompts
- use the surplus of pre-gathered materials, images, and excerpts from radical texts provided at the space
optionally print or scan your own photos or found items on our on-site printer
- meet and create with others in a structured and low pressure environment
- in the last hour, look at and talk about our pages, and assemble our collaborative zine
- after the event, pick up a riso printed copy of our collaborative zine artifact at boshi's on a later date, or have it shipped to you!

this workshop is designed for participants with no prior preparation or artistic experience to come and be in the space together, access and optionally share personal experiences or observations with (anti-)imperialism, and contribute as much or as little as they wish to a collaborative piece. by the end we will witness an anti-narrative collective memory emerge.

> The power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging, is very important to culture and imperialism, and constitutes one of the main connections between them.

coffee and snacks will be provided starting at 9:30am et, gluten free/dairy free options available - bring your own mug or borrow one of ours:)
