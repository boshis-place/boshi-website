  play some outdoor games against the empire

Come play games in the park with boshi's! We will start off with some chill folk games, then play the worker rights LARP "Boss Battle" by NYU alum Joel Jordon at 3pm. After that, we'll switch to some field games that will get everyone off their feet.

Feel free to join and leave at any time. We will provide warm tea and all game equipment. We have one of those big parachutes.
