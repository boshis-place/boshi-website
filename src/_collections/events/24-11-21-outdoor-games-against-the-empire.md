  join us outside to use public space for play, featuring a mug swap, new games, and a boss battle
---
## do you want to:
- use public space for play?
- willfully discard valuable productivity time?
- play games in the grass?
- with others who feel the same?

## great! between our zine jam and curated exhibition, we (boshi's place) are hosting an outdoor games event:
- in cooper park
- on thursday, november 26th
- at 1pm
- to 5pm (or maybe later)

## after the zine jam, grab some lunch and come by the park for:
- lunch on blankets (bring one if you want)
- a **mug swap!** bring a mug, swap with someone, get free hot tea!
- chill intro & warmup activities
- the worker rights larp <cite>**boss battle**</cite> by joel jordon
- games with a parachute
- field games in the **"new games"** tradition
- and more! (perhaps an evening d√©rive)

## some things to keep in mind:
- <u>dress warmly!</u>
- bring a **clean mug** if you want to participate in the mug swap
- we'll have some cups available, just in case
- there may be other reasons to bring your own mug ;)

hope to see you there!
