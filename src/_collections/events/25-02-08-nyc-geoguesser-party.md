Think you know NYC? On Saturday, 2/8 join us for our first ever Geoguesser Party and Tournament!

Try out the new custom-coded, NYC-specific, (and free) version of Geoguesser made specifically for this event! Bring friends, bring phones and/or laptops, and bring your city pride. There will be prizes!

Doors at 7:00
Practice rounds at 7:30
Tournament at 8:00

Bring one laptop or two phones per team! Come alone or with friends- weâ€™ll make teams :^)
NYC-ish prizes awarded to the winners- good luck!
