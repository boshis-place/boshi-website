  boshi's x Night City Games. a gallery show exhibiting games against the empire
---
in collaboration with [Night City Games](https://nightcity.games)

Over the past year, many of New York City's academic institutions have methodically shut down protests and censored conversations. In response, Boshi's Place is hosting a night featuring the stories and voices of colonized people around the world.

GAMES AGAINST THE EMPIRE is a gallery show curated in partnership with Night City Games, exhibiting a collection of independent games that mechanically or thematically examine imperialism, colonialism, oppression, and resistance.

Come play, hang out, meet the designers, and engage in thoughtful dialogue with our community!
