  boshi's x Night City Games. a gallery show exhibiting games against the empire
---
come to boshi's place for a gallery show curated in partnership with [Night City Games](https://nightcity.games/), exhibiting games that mechanically or thematically examine imperialism, colonialism, oppression, and/or resistance.

over the past year, we've seen new york city's academic institutions shut down protests and conversations in their student bodies. boshi's wants to take a stand in opposition to this by using our platform to highlight stories and voices of colonized people around the world.

we'll be showing a large collection of independent projects, dealing with oppression and resistance across human history, from the distant past to the present moment and gaza.

play, hang out, and discuss with our community and old and new friends.
