> hello RPG book club friendsâ€”due to some complicated scheduling shenanigans, we are *not* meeting tomorrow on Thursday, but instead we are meeting next week, Thursday, March 6th, at 5:00pm (instead of 7, since there are later events at boshi's that day), but that does give you an extra week to read SETTLERS OF A DEAD GOD, this week's book
