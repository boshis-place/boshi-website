Join us for karaoke with songs you know and lyrics no one has ever heard before. 

We use text and images from the internet to create live-generated mashups, with each line matching the original melody syllable for syllable.

You can request any combination of song + lyrics source in the catalog to sing solo, as a group or as a whole-crowd choir. Come help us make karaoke harder for everyone.

Hosted by Jamie Brew and Jenn Schiffer!
