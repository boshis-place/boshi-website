  boshi's x Night City Games. a panel on anti-imperialist games featuring designers and activists
---
in collaboration with [Night City Games](https://nightcity.games)

Modern games history is entangled with the capitalist, colonialist, and oppressive structures that rule us. While games can reinforce dominant ideologies, how can they also reveal what's broken within these structures of power? What alternative systems are possible, and how can we create art that actively engages with and transforms society?

In conjunction with our gallery show [GAMES AGAINST THE EMPIRE](./24-11-21-games-against-the-empire-showcase), we're hosting a panel featuring game developers, artists, and academics to discuss the role of game & artmaking in resisting imperialism and driving social change.

We will also stream this event! [twitch.tv/boshisplace](https://twitch.tv/boshisplace).
