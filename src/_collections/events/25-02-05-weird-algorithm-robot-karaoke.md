Join us for karaoke night on impossible mode as we replace the lyrics to any SONG with words from any TEXT, then try to sing the results on the spot. It all happens live, so each song has never been heard before and will never be heard again.

THE WEIRD ALGORITHM songwriting system matches each line syllable-for-syllable, so you can sing along if you know the original tune.

Request any of the 100+ songs and 50+ texts in the catalog. Sign up to sing as an individual or a group...or sit back and watch the karaoke carnage.

Past combos include:
YELP REVIEWS OF PSYCHICS to the tune of TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART
CRAIGSLIST VEHICLE ADS to the tune of TAKE ME HOME COUNTRY ROADS
NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF PROFESSORS to the tune of VAMPIRE
BERNIE SANDERS EMAIL SUBJECT LINES to the tune of DON’T STOP BELIEVIN’
